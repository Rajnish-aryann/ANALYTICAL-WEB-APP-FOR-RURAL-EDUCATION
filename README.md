Two web-portals and doing data analytics to solve problems related to rural education
Google says that major problems that hamper rural education are related to teachers, books, classrooms, etc. and often these are not solved or followed-up because solution is not provided in a constructive way.

So what I did is, I made a portal for people like undergraduate students, or dedicated teachers who love to teach, to register on that portal. Next I analysed the data and found out the best suited teachers, the subjects they want to teach, the time they can devote per week, etc. so that the routine is prepared in a proper way and education is preached flawlessly. So that there is no irregularity of classes, teachers not being able to teach, etc. Students will be interested because we can provide them a stipend and volunteering certificate because everyone wants volunteering certificates which help them for their higher education or in jobs, etc. 

Now I've built a 2nd portal, where a govt. representative will be there in the school, and on a daily basis feedback will be taken from the students. What problems they are facing, why education is not happening properly, etc. Again I did analytics to find out, what are the major problems, where is it happening, whether the problem is actually getting solved after being reported, etc. For ex. someone on 14th February has complained that teacher is not providing proper education, again the same problem has been reported by someone else on 20th February, so we get to know that problem is not getting solved and there's a loophole.
